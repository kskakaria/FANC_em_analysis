# FANC_em_analysis
Building off the EM connectome generated by Phelps et al (2020) I am analysing the downstream neural connectivity of a particular class of descending neuron called DNg02.  These neurons project from the lateral accessory lobe (LAL) to the wing neuropil of the ventral nerve cord (VNC).  Here, I generate a set of functions and analyze the connectivity of the entire class of DNg02s to motor neurons and interneurons directly upstream of motor neurons.

The library emlibrary.py includes functions to update segment ids and find the graph connectivity of those segments to motor neurons and analyze that graph to determine the structure of the connections.
